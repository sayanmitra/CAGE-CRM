Several models are used for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD), each designed to assess the risk of an individual developing a heart-related condition over a period of time. These models typically take into account various risk factors, including age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking status, and other health indicators. Here are some of the most commonly used cardiovascular risk prediction models:

1.	Framingham Risk Score (FRS)

•	Purpose: One of the most widely known models, developed from the Framingham Heart Study, to estimate the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) or other cardiovascular events.
•	Risk Factors: Age, gender, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking, and diabetes.
•	Strengths: Well-validated in various populations and straightforward to use.
•	Limitations: Primarily based on data from white populations in the US, making it less applicable to other ethnic groups.

2.	 QRISK Score

•	Purpose: A model developed in the UK to estimate the 10-year risk of CVD, with more attention to contemporary risk factors and ethnic diversity.
•	Risk Factors: Age, sex, cholesterol ratio, blood pressure, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), family history, deprivation, and medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation and diabetes.
•	Strengths: Includes additional factors like ethnicity, social deprivation, and chronic conditions, making it more relevant to diverse populations.
•	Limitations: Limited to UK populations, which may not fully generalise to other regions.

3.	Reynolds Risk Score

•	Purpose: Developed to improve on existing models by including markers of inflammation, specifically for predicting the risk of CVD in women, though there is also a version for men.
•	Risk Factors: Age, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), smoking, and family history of premature CVD.
•	Strengths: The inclusion of hsCRP, an inflammatory marker, adds predictive value in certain individuals.
•	Limitations: Requires the measurement of hsCRP, which is not always available or practical in routine clinical settings.

4.	SCORE (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation)

•	Purpose: A European model to estimate 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality.
•	Risk Factors: Age, gender, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and smoking status.
•	Strengths: Tailored to European populations with region-specific risk charts.
•	Limitations: Focuses solely on the risk of cardiovascular mortality, not on the incidence of non-fatal events.

5.	Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE)

•	Purpose: Developed by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association to estimate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including heart attack and stroke.
•	Risk Factors: Age, sex, race, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and use of blood pressure medications.
•	Strengths: Specifically designed for contemporary US populations and includes different risk equations for black and non-black individuals.
•	Limitations: It may overestimate risk in certain populations, particularly those with lower levels of risk factors.

6.	CVD Risk Charts by the World Health Organization (WHO)

•	Purpose: Developed for use in low- and middle-income countries to predict the 10-year risk of a major cardiovascular event.
•	Risk Factors: Age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and presence of diabetes.
•	Strengths: Specifically aimed at global use, particularly in resource-limited settings.
•	Limitations: May lack precision due to the exclusion of certain biomarkers or more detailed clinical data.

7.	MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) Risk Score

•	Purpose: Designed to predict coronary heart disease risk by incorporating coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring.
•	Risk Factors: Age, gender, race, smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure, family history, diabetes, and CAC score.
•	Strengths: Incorporates a direct measure of atherosclerosis (CAC), which improves risk prediction, especially in intermediate-risk patients.
•	Limitations: Requires CAC scoring, which involves imaging (CT scan), thus not widely available in all healthcare settings.

8.	CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc

•	Purpose: Primarily used to estimate the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, which is closely linked to CVD.
•	Risk Factors: Congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc includes additional factors like sex and vascular disease).
•	Strengths: Simple scoring system used extensively in patients with atrial fibrillation.
•	Limitations: Specific to patients with atrial fibrillation and not general CVD risk prediction.

9.	Globorisk

•	Purpose: A global risk prediction tool designed to estimate the 10-year risk of cardiovascular events across various countries.
•	Risk Factors: Age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes.
•	Strengths: Adaptable for different countries and regions, using local risk factor prevalence and mortality data.
•	Limitations: Still relatively new, so it may need further validation in certain populations.

10.	ASSIGN Score

•	Purpose: A Scottish cardiovascular risk prediction tool.
•	Risk Factors: Includes similar factors to other models but also incorporates social deprivation and family history of CVD.
•	Strengths: Tailored for the Scottish population, with adjustments for social deprivation.
•	Limitations: Primarily validated in Scottish populations.
